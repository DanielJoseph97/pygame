# Asteroids pygame  

Asteroids is developed using *pygame*, a popular python module for writing games. This project was created as part of the Backend Developer course in Python and Go taught at Boot.Dev

## Version 1 features:
- Single player on single ship
- Player can traverse in all directions and rotate on the spot
- Player can shoot bullets to destory Asteroids
- Asteroids can be of 3 sizes; small, medium and large. On being destroyed, asteroids of large size will split into two medium size asteroids and shoot off in random directions. This continues till small asteroids are completely destroyed.

**Version 2** is planned in the future, as there are various ways to expand the game in meaningful ways.
